Scientific Calculator

A simple command-line scientific 
calculator in Python. This application 
provides users with a range of mathematical 
functions and operations, including basic arithmetic,
trigonometry, logarithmic calculations, and more.
It features persistent storage, allowing users to save their 
calculations and access them later.

Features

Basic Operations: Perform standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Advanced Functions: Supports trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic operations, square roots, exponents, and more.

Persistent Storage: Saves calculations to a file, so results remain accessible even after closing the program.

View Calculations: Displays a history of all stored calculations.

Clear History: Option to delete saved calculations for a fresh start.


How It Works

Calculations are stored in a file named calculations.txt. Each calculation is saved with its result, allowing users to review past results or clear the history as needed.

Example

--- Scientific Calculator ---

1. Perform a calculation
2. View saved calculations
3. Clear calculation history
4. Exit
Choose an option (1-4): 1

Enter expression: sin(45) + log(10)
Result: 1.8495
